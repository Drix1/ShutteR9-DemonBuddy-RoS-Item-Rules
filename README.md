# DemonBuddy Item Rules for RoS
This is my item rules that I keep updated for DemonBuddy. There have been a lot of updates to Diablo 3 including its expansion, Reaper of Souls. The biggest change is the higher level cap, which makes all items considerably stronger, thus making all old item rules for DemonBuddy old and obsolete.

## How to Setup & Install
1. Download these item rules either using [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and cloning this repo (best), or simply downloading the .Zip file [here](https://github.com/ShutteR9/ShutteR9-DemonBuddy-RoS-Item-Rules/archive/master.zip)
2. Place these in a folder outside of your DemonBuddy folder
3. Tell Trinity to use file-based rules, and select "Custom" from the drop down menu. Next, choose the optional path to the new item rules folder by browsing and selecting the folder you just created. _Images for the less familiar_:

4. Click "Reload script rules" and you should see the rules show in the DB log. Save these settings and you won't have to do this again :)

## Troubleshooting
If you have any problems setting this up, please don't waste your time asking me. Do yourself and everyone a favor and either check my thread, or browse the DemonBuddy forums for help doing this. You'll learn much more by figuring stuff out on your own, trust me ;)
